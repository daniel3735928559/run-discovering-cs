This is the folder where homeworks will be stored.  The directory 
structure will be: Every time a homework is backed up, a folder will be 
created for with name `[YYYYMMDD]_[HHMMSS]` for the date and time the 
backup occurred, with subdirectories for all the student IDs with stored 
homework data, each containing subdirectory containing all that 
student's submitted homework in files names 
`[hw_number].[problem_number]`.
